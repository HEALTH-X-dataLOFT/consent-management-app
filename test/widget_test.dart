// This is an example Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.
//
// Visit https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/widget/introduction for
// more information about Widget testing.
